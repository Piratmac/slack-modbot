# slack-keywords-bot
Slack bot for responding to keywords (helps manage users)

This bot was created to provide guidance for unknown and numerous users that would be lost.
The idea is to reply in private to the user when some keywords are mentioned (Slackbot allows the same behavior, but replies publicly).

I'm not a Python expert. Neither am I a professional developer, so use anything here at your own risk!
