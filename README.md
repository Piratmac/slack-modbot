# Slack Modbot
Slack bot for managing large communities and high volume of users.

The initial idea was to reply to keywords and redirect users to the right channel.
The bot is meant in a modular way, meaning new extensions can be added (quite) easily.

Currently:
- The Keywords extension will reply to users with specific keywords, in an ephemeral message (rather than in public like Slackbot)
- There are no other extension built yet
